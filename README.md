# Telecommunication-Membership-Prediction-with-KNN
Built a model to predict the membership class of new customers using their demographic data. It is trained using the demographic data of old customers


This dataset is for a telecommunication provider that has segmented its customers base by serive usage patterns, categorizing customers into four groups. And wonders if the demographic data can be used to predict group membership. the company can customize offers for individual prospective customers. It is a classification problem. That is, given the dataset,  with predefined labels, we need to build a model to be used to predict class of a new or unknown case.

The target field, called **custcat**, has four possible service categories that correspond to the four customer groups, as follows:

1. Basic Service
2. E-Service
3. Plus Service
4. Total Service

Our objective is to build a classifier to predict the service category for unknown cases. We will use a specific type of classification called K-nearest neighbors.
